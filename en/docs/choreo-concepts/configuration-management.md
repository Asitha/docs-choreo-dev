# Configuration Management

Choreo allows you to store, retrieve, and share configurations for your components across multiple components within an organization. A configuration is an input to the components and is a key-value pair that comes in the form of environment variables, files, and command-line arguments. Users can specify the configuration values per each environment in Choreo.

## Types of Configurations
Configuration values can be categorized into three types:

- **Secret**: Information that needs to be securely stored.
- **File**: File-based configurations.
- **Text Value**: Plain text configurations.
