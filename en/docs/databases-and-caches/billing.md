# Billing for Platform Services (Databases and Caches)

Any platform services created under your Choreo Organization will be added to your existing Choreo subscription (the amount will depend on the service plan of the created resources).

- Usage is billed hourly. If you create a database and then remove it later on, you will only be billed for the hours that it was active for that month.
- Fixed pricing based on service plans. Choreo does not charge extra for network bandwith usage.


!!!Tip "Try out the free trial"
    Choreo provides a 14-day free trial for all database types on the 'Hobbyist' service plan (for free tier users).
