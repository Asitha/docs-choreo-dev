# Developing Integrations with Ballerina

WSO2 Ballerina is a programming language that is designed specifically for integration. Ballerina provides a 
comprehensive set of features and tools for building and deploying integrations. It is a modern, cloud-native language 
that offers a clean syntax and is designed to be simple, efficient, and expressive. Ballerina provides a range of 
built-in libraries and tools for connecting to a variety of services and data sources, including APIs, databases, and 
messaging systems. It also supports deployment on various platforms, including cloud and on-premises environments.

WSO2 Ballerina-based integrations provide several advantages over traditional integration solutions. Firstly, Ballerina 
provides a unified programming model for integrating different systems and services. This means that developers only 
need to learn one language and one set of tools, making it easier to build and deploy integrations. Secondly, Ballerina 
provides a range of security and performance features that make it easier to ensure the security and reliability of 
integrations. Finally, Ballerina provides a cloud-native deployment model, making it easier to deploy and manage 
integrations in the cloud.

In summary, WSO2 Ballerina is a new programming language that is designed specifically for integration. It provides a 
comprehensive set of features and tools for building and deploying integrations, and offers several advantages over 
traditional integration solutions, including a unified programming model, security and performance features, and a 
cloud-native deployment model.

## Integration Types

Choreo supports following types of MI Integrations

- __Integration as an API__
- __Event-Triggered Integration__
- __Scheduled Integration__
- __Manually-Triggered Integration__

## Develop with VS code
Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a versatile code editor that provides a rich user interface for developing integrations 
using Ballerina. Ballerina is a modern programming language designed specifically for integration, and the Ballerina 
extension for VS Code adds a range of features and tools that help developers create high-quality integrations.

With the Ballerina extension for VS Code, developers can take advantage of Ballerina-specific features, including syntax 
highlighting, code completion, error checking, and debugging. The integrated debugger provides an easy-to-use interface 
for identifying and resolving issues with your integrations. The built-in terminal also provides a convenient way to run 
commands and test your integrations.

The Ballerina extension for VS Code also provides a range of user interface elements, including visual diagrams and code 
snippets, which make it easier for developers to create and manage their integrations. The visual diagrams provide a 
visual representation of your integrations, making it easier to see how different systems and services are connected.
